- Anything new on your end perhaps? [-1 conversations]
	bar_owner: Not much. Although the drunkard isn’t here like usual. Kinda strange if you ask me. He’s always around the bar. Maybe something happened to him. Who knows.

- Did the samurai ever act suspicious before the murder? [-1 conversations]
	bar_owner: Funny you ask. He came here two days before the murder, drinking heavily for the first time in weeks while crying a bit I think. Something was clearly on his mind.

	- Did he say anything? [-1 conversations]
		bar_owner: I tried asking him why he suddenly stopped becoming a regular. He just said that it was due to health reasons and told me to leave him alone as he continued to drown his sorrows.
